## Writeup
Kcbowhunter's challenge which means once again we need to pass the flag as parameter. Trying to give wrong flag results in getting "wrong flag" message.

I run GDB and try to disassemble main and see lots of different function calls so I don't even bother to understand and straight away start the program in 
GDB, using `ni` to go one instruction each time and analyze the code.

After all the prints, the program calls `get_wall_time()`, which returns current time in some form, later after different checks and more prints it calls
it again, finds the difference and checks if the time passed since is greater then 2, it will print a message saying "You are too slow in the debugger bro!"
which is funny a little. Anyway I place a breakpoint right after this comparrison, run again and continue run one instruction each time and undestand the
code.

```
0x55555555511e <main+94>     call   0x555555556390                <0x555555556390>
 
 â–º 0x555555555123 <main+99>     test   al, al
   0x555555555125 <main+101>    je     main+290                <main+290>
```

I get to here, and the value of `al` is 0, I know that previously it was containing the time difference so I think maybe I should wait a second, I try to run
the program once again but making the time difference be 1, yet still  `al` will be 0 after the call at main+94, which means that is the function that 
checks for the flag and I want to disassemble it, let's just say it's not very clear what is going on there so I decide to run again and enter inside the
function, check the registers and see what is going on.

Doing so gives me a better understanding of what is happening. First,
```
0x0000555555556398 <+8>:     call   0x555555555090 <strlen@plt>
   0x000055555555639d <+13>:    movzx  edx,BYTE PTR [rip+0x2d3c]        # 0x5555555590e0 <msg5>
   0x00005555555563a4 <+20>:    mov    r8,rax
   0x00005555555563a7 <+23>:    xor    eax,eax
   0x00005555555563a9 <+25>:    cmp    rdx,r8
   0x00005555555563ac <+28>:    jne    0x5555555563e5 <_Z8CheckMsgPKc+85>
```
This part of the code checks that the length of the flag is equal to the value at `msg5`, which is 33. I run the program again this time giving a flag
of length 33. Next interesting thing is this loop:
```
   0x00005555555563d0 <+64>:    add    rax,0x1
   0x00005555555563d4 <+68>:    cmp    ecx,eax
   0x00005555555563d6 <+70>:    jle    0x5555555563f0 <_Z8CheckMsgPKc+96>
   0x00005555555563d8 <+72>:    movzx  edx,BYTE PTR [rbx+rax*1]
   0x00005555555563dc <+76>:    xor    edx,esi
   0x00005555555563de <+78>:    cmp    BYTE PTR [rdi+rax*1],dl
   0x00005555555563e1 <+81>:    je     0x5555555563d0 <_Z8CheckMsgPKc+64>
```
`rax` is the counter and the loop will run 33 times. We end up with just 3 instructions that check the validation of the flag:
```
   0x00005555555563d8 <+72>:    movzx  edx,BYTE PTR [rbx+rax*1]
   0x00005555555563dc <+76>:    xor    edx,esi
   0x00005555555563de <+78>:    cmp    BYTE PTR [rdi+rax*1],dl
```
`rbx` contains the address of our input flag, `rdi` contains address to some random string, well, it's not random we know it's the flag but encrypted.
You can see that this flag is xor encrypted `xor    edx,esi`, value of `esi` I see easily in GDB and its 0x7e, I also can print the string at `rdi`,
then using pyhton decrypt it and get the flag.

```
e = '=*8\022\033\037\f\020\005,\v\026\f\030\033\r\n\r\016\027\033\022\033!8\033\r\n\027\b\037\022\003'
d = ''
for p in e: d += chr(ord(p) ^ 0x7e)
```
